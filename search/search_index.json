Introduction Qutex is a basic Queue Management System that was designed as a Cisco Webex bot. The primary goal was to provide a system, interactable within Cisco Webex, that can be used to manage shared resources or any other task where a queue might be helpful. It can be used to manage who is using a particular resource or it can be used to track whose turn it is to perform a particular task, such as doing Agile retrospectives or restocking the refridgerator. Written in typescript, containerized via docker-compose, and hosted in AWS, it has been designed from the ground up to serve this one particular function. Current Status Activity Test Coverage Getting Started In Qutex, simply add qutex@webex.bot to any room or you can send a direct message. Once you have done that, you will need to create a project . A Qutex Project is essentially a \"bucket\" for Qutex Queues . You can create a qutex project with the command: create project <project_name> Where <project_name> is replaced with the name of the project you want to create. Warning Project names must be unique in qutex. Thus, you cannot create a project with a name that already exists. Additionally, the name of the project can only contain lowercase and uppercase alphabetical characters, spaces, and the underscore. Note Your project will automatically be put in uppercase regardless of how it was entered Example Note Whenever you are in a room, you must tag Qutex before the command in order for Qutex to respond. When you issue the create project command, Qutex will create a project for you with a default queue (named \"DEFAULT\"), it will register your location to the newly created project, and it will assign you as an admin of the project. Now you can begin using Qutex with the add me or add person command! If you have any questions, you can use the help command .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-qutex-documentation-page","text":"","title":"Welcome to the Qutex Documentation Page!"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Qutex is a basic Queue Management System that was designed as a Cisco Webex bot.

An administrator is someone that is responsible for managing a project and all its components. This includes anything that is stored under the project, which includes queues and other administrators. Administrator Privileges Administrator privileges are the permissions that a project administrator has. This includes running commands that are not runnable by anyone else. A list of those commands can be found here Recommendations All project administrators should manage the users for that project with respect.

You can change this by using the set current queue to (/queues/#changing-the-current-queue) command What is the Default Queue? The default queue is the queue that is automatically created in your project when it is first created . The name of this queue is always \"DEFAULT\". You can immediately begin using the default queue after a project has been created without needing to manually create a queue. However, you are also able to create your own queue if you so choose. You are not limitted by the existing of the default queue in any way. What is the Current Queue? In qutex, any action you perform on a queue within a project is, by default, performed on the current queue. Because you can have multiple queues in a project, you are able to change the current queue as the needs of your resource management demands. You can also use the queue suffix with relevant commands to operate on non-current queues. Changing the Current Queue Public You can change the current queue using the following command: Generic set current queue to <queue_name> Valid Example set current queue to valid Invalid Example set current queue to NOT&^%VALID Regex ^\\s*set (current )?queue to [\\w\\s]+\\s*$ Note Every project must always have one and only one current queue at a time.

Bill Nye (May 19, 2021 12:55:05 AM EST) Empty Queue \"DEFAULT\" is empty Getting Estimated Time Remaining for Me Public Qutex can give you an estimated time remaining until you are moved to the head of the queue. The formulas to do this are outline below: Formula \\(f(\\gamma, n)\\) \\(f\\) is the function to calculate how long until a person in queue position \\(n\\) reaches the head of the queue. \\[ \\begin{equation*} f(\\gamma, n)=\\begin{cases} 0 \\quad &\\text{if} \\, n = 0\\\\ \\max(g(\\gamma, 0) - \\alpha, 0) \\quad &\\text{if} \\, n = 1 \\\\ g(\\gamma, n) + f(h(\\gamma), n-1)) \\quad &\\text{if} \\, n \\notin {0,1} \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation*} \\] \\(\\gamma\\) represents the current queue data. \\(\\alpha\\) is the amount of time that has elapsed since the current head of the queue was promoted. \\(g(\\gamma, n)\\) \\(g\\) is the function which calculates average time to flush a person, whom is currently at queue position \\(n\\) , from the head of the queue. \\[ \\begin{equation*} g(\\gamma, n)=\\begin{cases} 0 \\quad &\\text{if} \\, n = 0\\\\ \\frac{\\beta}{|\\beta|} \\quad &\\text{if} \\, n \\neq 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation*} \\] \\(\\beta\\) is the number of seconds total that the person at position \\(n\\) in \\(\\gamma\\) has ever been at the head of the queue. \\(|\\beta|\\) is the number of times that the person at position \\(n\\) in \\(\\gamma\\) has ever been at the head of the queue. \\(h(\\gamma)\\) \\(h\\) is a function that produces the current queue except with the current head removed and all the members shifted up one. Note This is just an estimation and can never be 100% accurate To get this estimation, you can use the following command: Generic how long Regex ^\\s*how long\\s*$ Example Given that there is 1 person ahead of you. Your estimated wait time is 00:01:51 Getting Largest Queue Depth Public Qutex can give you the largest queue depth for a given queue over the entire lifetime of that queue. You can do this by invoking the following command: Generic get largest queue depth Regex ^\\s*get largest queue depth\\s*$ Once invoked, Qutex will return the maximum depth that the queue has ever been as well as the date and time of when that depth last occurred.

There are a few things that can help here. Help Command The help command will return a Cisco Webex card containing the available commands that exist as well as their authorization levels. It will also display some basic information about the release, the documentation, the author, the release date, and a link where you can open issues. Using Debug mode If you add | debug to the end of any command, Qutex will return the debug information to you within your Cisco Webex client. This can be very useful for debugging how Qutex operated on the command that you sent and can be key to determining why a particular workflow is not working, should that occur.
