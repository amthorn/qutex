## Modifying a Queue Name

Unfortunately, modifying the name of an existing queue is not currently possible with Qutex. You would need to delete the queue and create a new one with the new name.

## Listing the Queues in a Project

## What is the Default Queue?

The default queue is the queue that is automatically created in your project when it is first [created](../projects/#creating-a-new-project). The name of this queue is always "DEFAULT". You can immediately begin using the default queue after a project has been created without needing to manually create a queue. However, you are also able to [create your own queue](../queues/#creating-a-new-queue) if you so choose. You are not limitted by the existing of the default queue in any way.

## Setting the Current Queue

<!-- TO AVA: note that a project requires at least one current queue at all times. -->
