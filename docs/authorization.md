## None {% include "public_shield.md" %}

If a command requires no permissions, otherwise known as a public command, then anyone can execute that command without the need for any special permissions.

## Project Administrator {% include "auth_project_admin_shield.md" %}

If a command requires project administrator permission, then only those who are registered as a [project administrator](/administration) can execute that command.

## Super Administrator {% include "auth_super_admin_shield.md" %}

If a command requires super administrator permission, then only those who are registered as a super administrator can execute that command.
